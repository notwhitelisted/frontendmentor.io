### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From this CSS/HTML practice, I realized that media queries are not my strongest and that my positioning needs some work. Really understanding how the different components work together is necessary to building a quality page for any product or idea. I plan to keep on reading and watching different videos to further enhance my skills. 

### Continued development

On future developments, I will plan to utilize more of media queries as well as getting better at positioning images and text with flexbox and grid. I am also looking forward to trying different techniques that I learn from reading other people's code, youtube, and documentations.
